  The goal of this project was to host an Ollama model on google cloud, and let users upload documents and have the model answer with the context given.
  It still has improvements to be made, but has met its marks in functionality.

# Usage:
  # How to upload documents:
   (DocumentAI as of now only accepts .txt and .json files)

   Simply drag and drop the file to anywhere of the screen, and the file will be uploaded with the next question you answer!
   An icon (not subtle), will appear to indicate the file uploaded:

  # How to chat:
   Type your message into the message box, and press the enter button on your keyboard to send the message to DocumentAI.
   Be a bit patient since it does take a bit to answer back, because of cold start (I tried leaving an instance running to avoid it but got hit with $130 bill in a day, so I abandoned that idea).
